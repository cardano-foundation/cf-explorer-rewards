This repository provides an API for retrieving reward data for stake pools and delegators. It utilizes [Koios](https://www.koios.rest/) to fetch the data, aggregates and stores it, and serves it for the cardano explorer.
It currently uses Koios to fetch the required data. A separate project to calculate the rewards without relying on DB Sync can be found [here](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-java-rewards-calculation).

ðŸ‘‰ Check the [Explorer repository](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-explorer) to understand how the microservices work together
